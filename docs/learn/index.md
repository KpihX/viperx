# ViperX Academy 🦅

Welcome to the **ViperX Academy**.

ViperX is not just a tool; it is a **mentor**. This section of the documentation serves as a knowledge base to help you understand the "Why" behind the "How".

Each topic below dives deep into the architectural decisions and modern tooling standards that ViperX automates for you.

## Topics

- **[Why uv?](uv.md)**: Speed, stability, and rust-based power.
- **[Modern Packaging](packaging.md)**: Understanding PEP 621 and `pyproject.toml`.
- **[Project Structure](structure.md)**: The importance of the `src/` layout.
- **[Configuration](config.md)**: Robust configuration management with `.env` isolation.
- **[Testing](testing.md)**: Best practices for unit and integration testing.

!!! tip "In the Terminal"
    You can also access condensed versions of these guides directly in your CLI:
